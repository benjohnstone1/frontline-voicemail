## Setup Requirements

Before we begin, we need to collect all the config values we need to run the application:

Account SID: Your primary Twilio account identifier - find this in the console here. (https://console.twilio.com/?frameUrl=/console)

## Create a configuration file for your application:

cp .env.example .env

Next, we need to install our dependencies from npm:

npm install
